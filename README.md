# Bump Action 

Bump allows you to..well...bump an npm package version using a commit message, and push the package.json update back to the repository.

# Create an action from this template
Click the `Use this Template` and provide the new repo details for your action


# Options
inputs: 
- github_token (required) - github access token.
- user (optional) - user name (default: the user of the current push).
- email (optional) - user email. (default: current user email).
- branch (optional) - branch to work against. (default: `master`).

outputs:
- version - the version being tagged and pushed.

# Bump strategy
If your head (latest) commit has the keywords `#patch`, `#minor` or `#major` - this action will use that to perform the bump.
Defaults to `patch`.

## Usage
You can consume the action by referencing the v1 branch

```yaml
bump:
  runs-on: ubuntu-latest
  steps:
  - uses: tool3/bump@master
    with:
      github_token: ${{ secrets.GP_TOKEN }}
      user: 'First Last'
      email: 'user.email@gmail.com'
```
## :warning: Important usage notes
- this action requires `@actions/checkout` to be defined in a previous step. e.g:   
```yaml
bump:
  runs-on: ubuntu-latest
  steps:
  - uses: actions/checkout@master
  - uses: tool3/bump@master
    with:
      github_token: ${{ secrets.GP_TOKEN }}
      user: 'First Last'
      email: 'user.email@gmail.com'
```
- this action pushes the package.json version update back to the repo (defaults to master).   
You must be aware of this to avoid build loops.
